# Push to GitHub Commands

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/VishakBaddur/procurvv-mvp.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
1. Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Or set up SSH keys
3. Or use GitHub Desktop

## Alternative: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

If git push doesn't work, you can:
1. Create a ZIP file of the project
2. Upload it via GitHub's web interface
3. Or use GitHub Desktop app
